## :information_source: About

Shiro 白 is a small monolithic x86 &amp; 64 Kernel which is able to process input and provide output accordingly.

The name "Shiro" itself is the Japanese word for "white" written in [Romaji](https://www.japanesepod101.com/japanese-romaji/). The symbol (白) is the japanese [Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji) for the word "white". 

I wanted to learn a bit about kernel development. And that's basically the whole purpose of this project/repository.

> **IMPORTANT:** This is a WIP and doesn't do anything yet! Also Im a C & NASM rookie and probably don't know what I am doing.

## :wrench: Build

-- Comming Soon --

For now you only need the following tools:

> - NASM for Bootloader stuff 
> - C for the Kernel itself 
> - Bash for build scripts
> - (Recommended:) Qemu as Type 2 Hypervisor / Emulator 

and then build & launch the kernel by starting `build.sh`
